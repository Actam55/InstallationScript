# InstallationScript


This is a script used to install software on a windows machine. Intended to be used for installing all needed software on a clean installation or format


**Considerations**
- Custom drive for installation.
- Better CLI design.
- Look at other options for installing software other than this weird ass Powershell way of doing it.
- Some software is limited, Riot client cannot be installed as download link has not been found yet. This issue could consist with future software.


**Software to add**
- Windows Terminal
- Python

**Current known issues**
- F.lux does not seem to download the installer correctly. Might have something to with the fact that the link is HTML or something
